## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to my **Computer Vision Learning Journey**! 🚀  

Over the next **3 months**, I’ll dive deep into **Computer Vision**, starting from the basics and gradually moving to advanced concepts. My goal is to **build real-world projects** while mastering key tools like:  

- **OpenCV** – image and video processing  
- **Mediapipe** – real-time hand, pose, and face detection  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** – deep learning and CNNs  
- **YOLO** – fast object detection  

This repo will be updated **weekly** with:  

- 📖 **Learning notes**  
- 🛠️ **Mini-projects & experiments**  
- 🚀 **Milestone projects**  

By the end, I aim to have **4 solid projects** demonstrating real-world CV applications.
